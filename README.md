# SQL---General


As a security analyst, you’ll often find that you need data from more than one table.

Previously, you learned that a relational database is a structured database containing tables that are related to each other.

SQL joins enable you to combine tables that contain a shared column. This is helpful when you need to connect information that appears in different tables.

In this lab activity, you’ll use SQL joins to connect separate tables and retrieve needed information.

Get ready to apply what you’ve learned and join some data!

Task 2. Investigate login activity
In this task, you need to analyze the information from the log_in_attempts table to determine if any unusual activity has occurred.

First, you need to investigate the locations where login attempts were made to ensure that they’re in expected areas (the United States, Canada, or Mexico).

Task 3. Order login attempts data
In this task, you need to use the ORDER BY keyword. You'll sequence the data that your query returns according to the login date and time.

First, you need to sort the information by date.

As a security analyst, you’ll often find that you need data from more than one table.

Previously, you learned that a relational database is a structured database containing tables that are related to each other.

SQL joins enable you to combine tables that contain a shared column. This is helpful when you need to connect information that appears in different tables.

In this lab activity, you’ll use SQL joins to connect separate tables and retrieve needed information.

Get ready to apply what you’ve learned and join some data!
